# CS 65 MyRun2

This is a readme file for MyRun2.

### Configuration 
This project is developed under Android Studio 3.3.2 with Android API level 23 and compileSdkVersion is 28.


### Overview
In this project, it continues the work from MyRun1 and adds extra activities. It creates a bottom tab using fragments in MainActivity and adds the functions of Settings and Edit Profile. In Edit Profile, it shows the options such as name, password when use registers, and also add the function of selecting picture from gallery.


### 2 warnings?
In ListAdapter.java, there are 2 warnings on super(), I have tried many times but cannot solve it. I customized my own ArrayAdapter by overriding the class ArrayAdapter, and I have to use super() to invoke parent method, but the parameters here I do not understand how to eliminate the warning.


### Extra Credit
I changed the Imageview to circle background using cardview.
